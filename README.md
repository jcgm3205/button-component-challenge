## Features

This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) challenge. The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/ohgVTyJCbm5OZyTB2gNY) was to build an application to complete the given user stories.

Also, for a more complete excercise presentation, a simple design - similar to a image gallery - was created. The idea behind this, was to put a 'Button' component (the main UI piece and the foundation of the challenge) inside a 'Card' component, in order to show its layout properties. And, each 'Card' has a brief featuring of each 'Button' to complete the layout.

Although in the Challenge page, there are no instructions regarding any possible utility for the 'Button' components, for the sake of completeness, every 'Button' has a small function added. When a 'Button' (except those containing the "Disabled" text) is clicked, an alert box appears, showing a legend.
