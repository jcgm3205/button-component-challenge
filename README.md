## Features

This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) challenge. The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/ohgVTyJCbm5OZyTB2gNY) was to build a set of UI components (specifically, a series of buttons ) to complete the given user stories. These buttons should had some particular layout properties and to be generated using a Front-End library like Vue. For this case, React was used.

Also, for a more complete excercise presentation, a simple design - similar to a image gallery - was created. The idea behind this, was to put a 'Button' component (the main UI piece and the foundation of the challenge) inside a 'Card' component, in order to show its layout properties. And, each 'Card' includes a brief featuring of each 'Button' to complete the layout.

Although in the Challenge page, there are no instructions regarding any possible utility for the 'Button' components, for the sake of completeness, every 'Button' has a small function added. When a 'Button' (except those containing the "Disabled" text) is clicked, an alert box appears, showing a legend.
