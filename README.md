## Overview

As indicated at the Challenge page, the goal was to generate a collection of reusable buttons with different design properties. I've been studying to become a Front-End Developer and to specialize in React, so in order to solve the challenge, that library was used.

React itself allows to generate various types of reusable UI components (that's, indeed, it's main reason to exist). However, there are many complementary libraries that helps to create components much easier and integrating desing issues in a more natural way. One of these is Styled Components.

Styled Components is a special library that deals with the CSS part of generating UI pieces for an app or a website. It allows to declare an HTML tag (like a <code>button</code> tag) and, immediately after, setting all the related style properties, from the padding or the border, to pseudoclasses, pseudoelements, specific classes, indications to possible tag's children, etc.          

### Built With


- [React](https://reactjs.org/)

## Features

This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) challenge. The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/ohgVTyJCbm5OZyTB2gNY) was to build a set of UI components (specifically, a series of buttons ) to complete the given user stories. These buttons should had some particular layout properties and to be generated using a Front-End library like Vue. For this case, React was used.

Also, for a more complete excercise presentation, a simple design - similar to a image gallery - was created. The idea behind this, was to put a 'Button' component (the main UI piece and the foundation of the challenge) inside a 'Card' component, in order to show its layout properties. And, each 'Card' includes a brief featuring of each 'Button' to complete the layout.

Although in the Challenge page, there are no instructions regarding any possible utility for the 'Button' components, for the sake of completeness, every 'Button' has a small function added. When a 'Button' (except those containing the "Disabled" text) is clicked, an alert box appears, showing a legend.
